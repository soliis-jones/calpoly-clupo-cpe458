Compiling:
  Running a simple "make" command will install the "TSP" executable to a bin directory in the present working directory.
  
  The program will compile on Cal Poly CSL machines unix11, unix12, unix13, and unix14 as well as all machines in the distributed systems lab.

Running:
  Our TSP executable takes in 2 positional command line arguments.
    1. The path and/or name of the input file.
    2. The number of iterations for each process (recommended 5x the number of nodes from input file)
    
  The input files should contain a line with the word "DIMENSION" followed by the total number of nodes in the current file on the same line. A line after that should include the text "NODE_COORD_SECTION" with all of the node coord information immediately following until EOF or the actual end of the file. Node coordinate lines should have 3 numbers per line which is in the format of [node_number, x_coordinate, y_coordinate]. 
  
  The output of our program will print the iteration number and process number when a new best tour value is received by the root node. Once the number of iterations has been reached the best path found will be printed along with the total distance.
