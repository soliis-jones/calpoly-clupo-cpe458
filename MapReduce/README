Usage: mapreduce <input_file>

In order to compile the program, the user needs to download the mrmpi library 
and follow the instructions to make the dynamic library (libmrmpi.so). When 
compiling, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable needs to have an entry for 
the directory containing the dynamic library file. Then, compile the program 
using "make" or "make all". The program must be run with the mpirun command 
provided by openmpi.

Example run: mpirun -n 10 mapreduce.c stockdata/aapl.csv
